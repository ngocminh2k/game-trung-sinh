Abstract 
In this paper we present the MDA framework (standing for 
Mechanics, Dynamics, and Aesthetics), developed and 
taught as part of the Game Design and Tuning Workshop at 
the Game Developers Conference, San Jose 2001-2004.   
 
MDA is a formal approach to understanding games – one 
which attempts to bridge the gap between game design and 
development, game criticism, and technical game research. 
We believe this methodology will clarify and strengthen the 
iterative processes of developers, scholars and researchers 
alike, making it easier for all parties to decompose, study 
and design a broad class of game designs and game 
artifacts.

Introduction

All artifacts are created within some design methodology. 
Whether building a physical prototype, architecting a 
software 
interface, 
constructing 
an 
argument 
or 
implementing a series of controlled experiments – design 
methodologies guide the creative thought process and help 
ensure quality work.  
 
Specifically, iterative, qualitative and quantitative analyses 
support the designer in two important ways. They help her 
analyze the end result to refine implementation, and 
analyze the implementation to refine the result. By 
approaching the task from both perspectives, she can 
consider 
a 
wide 
range 
of 
possibilities 
and 
interdependencies.  
 
This is especially important when working with computer 
and video games, where the interaction between coded 
subsystems 
creates 
complex, 
dynamic 
(and 
often 
unpredictable) behavior. Designers and researchers must 
consider interdependencies carefully before implementing 
changes, and scholars must recognize them before drawing 
conclusions about the nature of the experience generated. 
 
In this paper we present the MDA framework (standing for 
Mechanics, Dynamics, and Aesthetics), developed and 
taught as part of the Game Design and Tuning Workshop 
at the Game Developers Conference, San Jose 2001-2004 
[LeBlanc, 2004a].  MDA is a formal approach to 
understanding games – one which attempts to bridge the 
gap between game design and development, game 
criticism, and technical game research. We believe this

methodology will clarify and strengthen the iterative 
processes of developers, scholars and researchers alike, 
making it easier for all parties to decompose, study and 
design a broad class of game designs and game artifacts.

Towards a Comprehensive Framework

Game design and authorship happen at many levels, and 
the fields of games research and development involve 
people from diverse creative and scholarly backgrounds. 
While it’s often necessary to focus on one area, everyone, 
regardless of discipline, will at some point need to consider 
issues outside that area: base mechanisms of game 
systems, the overarching design goals, or the desired 
experiential results of gameplay.   
 
AI coders and researchers are no exception. Seemingly 
inconsequential decisions about data, representation, 
algorithms, tools, vocabulary and methodology will trickle 
upward, shaping the final gameplay. Similarly, all desired 
user experience must bottom out, somewhere, in code. As 
games continue to generate increasingly complex agent, 
object and system behavior, AI and game design merge. 
 
Systematic coherence comes when conflicting constraints 
are satisfied, and each of the game’s parts can relate to 
each other as a whole.  Decomposing, understanding and 
creating this coherence requires travel between all levels of 
abstraction – fluent motion from systems and code, to 
content and play experience, and back.  
 
We propose the MDA framework as a tool to help 
designers, 
researchers 
and 
scholars 
perform 
this 
translation.

MDA

Games are created by designers/teams of developers, and 
consumed by players. They are purchased, used and 
eventually cast away like most other consumable goods.

The production and consumption of game artifacts.


<!-- Trang 2 -->

The difference between games and other entertainment 
products (such as books, music, movies and plays) is that 
their consumption is relatively unpredictable. The string of 
events that occur during gameplay and the outcome of 
those events are unknown at the time the product is 
finished.   
 
The MDA framework formalizes the consumption of 
games by breaking them into their distinct components:

…and establishing their design counterparts:

Mechanics describes the particular components of the 
game, at the level of data representation and algorithms.  
 
Dynamics describes the run-time behavior of the 
mechanics acting on player inputs and each others’ 
outputs over time. 
 
Aesthetics describes the desirable emotional responses 
evoked in the player, when she interacts with the game 
system.  
 
Fundamental to this framework is the idea that games are 
more like artifacts than media. By this we mean that the 
content of a game is its behavior – not the media that 
streams out of it towards the player.  
 
Thinking about games as designed artifacts helps frame 
them as systems that build behavior via interaction. It 
supports clearer design choices and analysis at all levels of 
study and development.

MDA in Detail

MDA as Lens 
Each component of the MDA framework can be thought of 
as a “lens” or a “view” of the game – separate, but causally 
linked. [LeBlanc, 2004b].  
 
From the designer’s perspective, the mechanics give rise to 
dynamic system behavior, which in turn leads to particular 
aesthetic experiences. From the player’s perspective, 
aesthetics set the tone, which is born out in observable 
dynamics and eventually, operable mechanics.

When working with games, it is helpful to consider both 
the designer and player perspectives. It helps us observe 
how even small changes in one layer can cascade into 
others. In addition, thinking about the player encourages 
experience-driven (as opposed to feature-driven) design.   
 
As such, we begin our investigation with a discussion of 
Aesthetics, and continue on to Dynamics, finishing with 
the underlying Mechanics.

Aesthetics 
What makes a game “fun”? How do we know a specific 
type of fun when we see it? Talking about games and play 
is hard because the vocabulary we use is relatively limited.  
 
In describing the aesthetics of a game, we want to move 
away from words like “fun” and “gameplay” towards a 
more directed vocabulary. This includes but is not limited 
to the taxonomy listed here:

For example, consider the games Charades, Quake, The 
Sims and Final Fantasy.  While each are “fun” in their own 
right, it is much more informative to consider the aesthetic 
components that create their respective player experiences:

Charades: Fellowship, Expression, Challenge. 
Quake: Challenge, Sensation, Competition, Fantasy. 
The Sims: Discovery, Fantasy, Expression, Narrative. 
Final Fantasy: Fantasy, Narrative, Expression,       
Discovery, Challenge, Submission. 
 
Here we see that each game pursues multiple aesthetic 
goals, in varying degrees. Charades emphasizes Fellowship 
over Challenge; Quake provides Challenge as a main 
element of gameplay. And while there is no Grand Unified 
Theory of games or formula that details the combination 
and proportion of elements that will result in “fun”, this

The designer and player each have a different perspective.

2. Fantasy 
  Game as make-believe 
3. Narrative 
   Game as drama 
4. Challenge

7. Expression

taxonomy helps us describe games, shedding light on how 
and why different games appeal to different players, or to 
the same players at different times.

Aesthetic Models 
Using out aesthetic vocabulary like a compass, we can 
define models for gameplay. These models help us 
describe gameplay dynamics and mechanics.  
 
For example: Charades and Quake are both competitive. 
They succeed when the various teams or players in these 
games are emotionally invested in defeating each other. 
This requires that players have adversaries (in Charades, 
teams compete, in Quake, the player competes against 
computer opponents) and that all parties want to win.  
 
It’s easy to see that supporting adversarial play and clear 
feedback about who is winning are essential to competitive 
games. If the player doesn’t see a clear winning condition, 
or feels like they can’t possibly win, the game is suddenly 
a lot less interesting.

Dynamic Models 
Dynamics work to create aesthetic experiences. For 
example, challenge is created by things like time pressure 
and opponent play. Fellowship can be encouraged by 
sharing information across certain members of a session (a 
team) or supplying winning conditions that are more 
difficult to achieve alone (such as capturing an enemy 
base).   
 
Expression 
comes 
from 
dynamics 
that 
encourage 
individual users to leave their mark: systems for 
purchasing, building or earning game items, for designing, 
constructing and changing levels or worlds, and for 
creating personalized, unique characters. Dramatic tension 
comes from dynamics that encourage a rising tension, a 
release, and a denouement.  
 
As with aesthetics, we want our discussion of dynamics to 
remain as concrete as possible. By developing models that 
predict and describe gameplay dynamics, we can avoid 
some common design pitfalls.

For example, the model of 2 six-sided die will help us 
determine the average time it will take a player to progress 
around the board in Monopoly, given the probability of 
various rolls.

Similarly, we can identify feedback systems within 
gameplay to determine how particular states or changes 
affect the overall state of gameplay. In Monopoly, as the 
leader or leaders become increasingly wealthy, they can 
penalize players with increasing effectiveness. Poorer 
players become increasingly poor.

As the gap widens, only a few (and sometimes only one) of 
the players is really invested. Dramatic tension and agency 
are lost. 
 
Using our understanding of aesthetics and dynamics, we 
can imagine ways to fix Monopoly – either rewarding 
players who are behind to keep them within a reasonable 
distance of the leaders, or making progress more difficult 
for rich players. Of course – this might impact the game’s 
ability to recreate the reality of monopoly practices – but 
reality isn’t always “fun”.

Mechanics 
Mechanics are the various actions, behaviors and control 
mechanisms afforded to the player within a game context. 
Together with the game’s content (levels, assets and so on) 
the mechanics support overall gameplay dynamics.

For example, the mechanics of card games include 
shuffling, trick-taking and betting – from which dynamics 
like bluffing can emerge. The mechanics of shooters 
include weapons, ammunition and spawn points – which 
sometimes produce things like camping and sniping. The 
mechanics of golf include balls, clubs, sand traps and 
water hazards – which sometimes produce broken or 
drowned clubs. 
 
Adjusting the mechanics of a game helps us fine-tune the 
game’s overall dynamics. Consider our Monopoly 
example. Mechanics that would help lagging players could 
include bonuses or “subsidies” for poor players, and 
penalties or “taxes” for rich players – perhaps calculated 
when crossing the Go square, leaving jail, or exercising 
monopolies over a certain threshold in value.  By applying 
such changes to the fundamental rules of play, we might be 
able to keep lagging players competitive and interested for 
longer periods of time. 
 
Another solution to the lack of tension over long games of 
Monopoly would be to add mechanics that encourage time 
pressure and speed up the game. Perhaps by depleting 
resources over time with a constant rate tax (so people 
spend quickly), doubling all payouts on monopolies (so 
that players are quickly differentiated), or randomly 
distributing all properties under a certain value threshold.

Tuning 
Clearly, the last step our Monopoly analysis involves play 
testing and tuning. By iteratively refining the value of 
penalties, rate of taxation or thresholds for rewards and 
punishments, we can refine the Monopoly gameplay until 
it is balanced. 
 
When tuning, our aesthetic vocabulary and models help us 
articulate design goals, discuss game flaws, and measure 
our progress as we tune. If our Monopoly taxes require 
complex calculations, we may be defeating the player’s 
sense of investment by making it harder for them to track 
cash values, and therefore, overall progress or competitive 
standings.  
  
Similarly, our dynamic models help us pinpoint where 
problems may be coming from. Using the D6 model, we 
can evaluate proposed changes to the board size or layout, 
determining how alterations will extend or shorten the 
length of a game.

MDA at Work

Now, let us consider developing or improving the AI 
component of a game. It is often tempting to idealize AI 
components as black-box mechanisms that, in theory, can 
be injected into a variety of different projects with relative 
ease. But as the framework suggests, game components

cannot be evaluated in vacuo, aside from their effects on a 
system behavior and player experience.

First Pass 
Consider an example Babysitting game [Hunicke, 2004]. 
Your supervisor has decided that it would be beneficial to 
prototype a simple game-based AI for tag. Your player will 
be a babysitter, who must find and put a single baby to 
sleep. The demo will be designed to show off simple 
emotive characters (like a baby), for games targeted at 3-7 
year-old children.  
 
What are the aesthetic goals for this design? Exploration 
and discovery are probably more important than challenge. 
As such the dynamics are optimized here not for 
“winning” or “competition” but for having the baby 
express emotions like surprise, fear, and anticipation.  
 
Hiding places could be tagged manually, paths between 
them hard-coded; the majority of game logic would be 
devoted to maneuvering the baby into view and creating 
baby-like reactions. Gameplay mechanics would include 
talking to the baby (“I see you!” or “boo!”), chasing the 
baby (with an avatar or with a mouse), sneaking about, 
tagging and so on.

Second Pass 
Now, consider a variant of this same design – built to work 
with a franchise like Nickelodeon’s “Rugrats” and aimed 
at 7-12 year-old-girls. Aesthetically, the game should feel 
more challenging – perhaps there is some sort of narrative 
involved (requiring several “levels”, each of which 
presents a new piece of the story and related tasks). 
 
In terms of dynamics, the player can now track and interact 
with several characters at once. We can add time pressure 
mechanics (i.e. get them all to bed before 9 pm), include a 
“mess factor” or monitor character emotions (dirty diapers 
cause crying, crying loses you points) and so on.  
 
For this design, static paths will no longer suffice – and it’s 
probably a good idea to have them choose their own hiding 
places. Will each baby have individual characteristics, 
abilities or challenges? If so, how will they expose these 
differences to the player? How will they track internal 
state, reason about the world, other babies, and the player?  
What kinds of tasks and actions will the player be asked to 
perform?

Third Pass 
Finally, we can conceive of this same tag game as a full-
blown, strategic military simulation – the likes of Splinter 
Cell or Thief. Our target audience is now 14-35 year old 
men.  
 
Aesthetic goals now expand to include a fantasy element 
(role-playing the spy-hunting military elite or a loot-


<!-- Trang 5 -->

seeking rogue) and challenge can probably border on 
submission. In addition to an involved plot full of intrigue 
and suspense, the player will expect coordinated activity 
on the part of opponents – but probably a lot less 
emotional expression. If anything, agents should express 
fear and loathing at the very hint of his presence. 
 
Dynamics might include the ability to earn or purchase 
powerful weapons and spy equipment, and to develop 
tactics and techniques for stealthy movement, deceptive 
behavior, 
evasion 
and 
escape. 
Mechanics 
include 
expansive tech and skill trees, a variety of enemy unit 
types, and levels or areas with variable ranges of mobility, 
visibility and field of view and so on. 
 
Agents in this space, in addition to coordinating movement 
and attacks must operate over a wide range of sensory 
data. Reasoning about the player’s position and intent 
should indicate challenge, but promote their overall 
success. Will enemies be able to pass over obstacles and 
navigate challenging terrain, or will you “cheat”? Will 
sound propagation be “realistic” or will simple metrics 
based on distance suffice?

Wrapping Up

Here we see that simple changes in the aesthetic 
requirements of a game will introduce mechanical changes  
for its AI on many levels – sometimes requiring the 
development of entirely new systems for navigation, 
reasoning, and strategic problem solving. 
 
Conversely, we see that there are no “AI mechanics” as 
such – intelligence or coherence comes from the 
interaction of AI logic with gameplay logic. Using the 
MDA framework, we can reason explicitly about aesthetic 
goals, draw out dynamics that support those goals, and 
then scope the range of our mechanics accordingly.

Conclusions

MDA supports a formal, iterative approach to design and 
tuning. It allows us to reason explicitly about particular 
design goals, and to anticipate how changes will impact 
each aspect of the framework and the resulting 
designs/implementations.  
 
By moving between MDA’s three levels of abstraction, we 
can conceptualize the dynamic behavior of game systems. 
Understanding games as dynamic systems helps us develop 
techniques for iterative design and improvement – 
allowing us to control for undesired outcomes, and tune for 
desired behavior.  
 
In addition, by understanding how formal decisions about 
gameplay impact the end user experience, we are able to

better decompose that experience, and use it to fuel new 
designs, research and criticism respectively.
